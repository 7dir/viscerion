# \[ 🚧 Work in progress 👷‍♀️⛏👷🔧️👷🔧 🚧 \] Android GUI for [WireGuard](https://www.wireguard.com/)

This is an under construction rewrite of the WireGuard Android GUI. This fork was initiated for me
to have someplace for me to work on the app where _I_ decide what goes in, not somebody else
with zero app development experience or sense of UX.

**I HAVE NO INTENTION TO SUBMIT THIS UPSTREAM**

## Building

```
$ git clone https://github.com/MSF-Jarvis/wireguard-kt --recursive
$ cd wireguard-kt
$ ./gradlew assembleDebug
```

Note: on macOS you also need to install the GNU `coreutils` package through homebrew.
